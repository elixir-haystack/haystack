  "description": "The koala is a marsupial native to Australia, known for its distinctive appearance and tree-dwelling habits. They are herbivorous and feed almost exclusively on the leaves of eucalyptus trees. Koalas are known for their relaxed and sleepy demeanor, spending most of their day dozing in the trees. They have a special digestive system that allows them to break down the toxic compounds in eucalyptus leaves. Koalas are threatened by habitat loss, disease, and climate change."
